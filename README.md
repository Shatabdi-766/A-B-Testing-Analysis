# 🎯 A/B Testing Analysis  

Ever wondered how businesses decide which version of a product, website, or marketing strategy works best? That’s where **A/B Testing** comes in! 🚀  

This project explores **A/B Testing** using **Python** and **Machine Learning** to analyze experiments, measure performance, and make data-backed decisions.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- **Designing A/B Tests** – Setting up control & treatment groups effectively.  
- **Data Analysis** – Cleaning, visualizing, and understanding experiment data.  
- **Statistical Testing** – Hypothesis testing to determine significant differences.  
- **Machine Learning Models** – Predicting user behavior and optimizing experiments.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- 🐍 **Python** – Core language for analysis  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** – Enhancing test results with predictive models  
- 📊 **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation & preprocessing  
- 📈 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Interactive visualizations  

## 🚀 Workflow  
1️⃣ **Define the Experiment** – What are we testing? Who are the users?  
2️⃣ **Data Collection** – Gather user interactions and key metrics.  
3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncover trends & distributions.  
4️⃣ **Statistical Testing** – T-tests, Chi-square, and more!  
5️⃣ **Machine Learning Insights** – Predicting engagement & conversions.  
6️⃣ **Business Impact** – Making actionable recommendations.
